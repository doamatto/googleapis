# Google APIs for V
This is a library for all of the Google APIs written in Vlang using only modules in [vlib*.](https://modules.vlang.io/)

## Usage
Start by installing the package (`v install googleapis`) and importing it into your project (`import googleapis`). To see what functions there are and how to use this library:
- see the examples in `examples/`; or:
- [read the documentation]() or generate (`v doc googleapis`) the documentation.

## Acknowledgements
This library is licensed under the MIT license. This is not an official Google wrapper, nor is it affiliated with:
- Google,
- Google Cloud Platform or Firebase,
- Google Assistant,
- YouTube; or:
- Google Maps.

I'll make a TensorFlow library in the futureâ„¢.

## Footnotes
\* I'm going to try and do it all in vlib (so far, so good), but I can't guarantee it. Vlang is still on the new side to me.
